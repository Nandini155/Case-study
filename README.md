ðŸ“Š Case Study: Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company
Scenario:
A large telecom company is experiencing a significant number of customer churns (customers leaving the service). They want to understand the reasons behind customer churn, identify customers at risk, and take steps to reduce it.


# Step 1: Problem Definition
## Objective:
1. Identify factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Build a predictive model to classify customers as either "likely to churn" or "not likely to churn."
3. Provide actionable insights to reduce churn.
## Business Metrics:
1. Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who leave the service over a given period.
2. Retention Rate: The percentage of customers retained.
3. Accuracy of the Predictive Model: How well the model identifies churners.

# Step 2: Data Collection
Data Sources:
Customer usage data (e.g., call duration, internet usage).
Customer demographic data (e.g., age, gender, location).
Service details (e.g., plan type, contract duration).
Customer service interactions (e.g., complaints, support tickets).
Sample Dataset Overview:
Customer ID	Age	Gender	Plan Type	Tenure (months)	Monthly Charges	Total Charges	Support Tickets	Churn (Yes/No)
1001	34	M	Premium	12	$70	$840	1	No
1002	45	F	Basic	2	$30	$60	3	Yes
1003	29	F	Standard	8	$50	$400	0	No
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...


# Step 3: Data Preparation
## Data Cleaning:
1. Handle Missing Values: Replace missing values in fields like Total Charges with the median or mean.
2. Remove Duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate customer records.
3. Convert Data Types: Ensure Total Charges and Monthly Charges are numeric types.
## Feature Engineering:
1. Create New Features:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Monthly Charges * Tenure
Customer Support Interaction Rate: Support Tickets / Tenure
2. Encode Categorical Variables: Convert Plan Type and Gender into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
## Data Normalization:
Normalize continuous variables (e.g., Monthly Charges, Total Charges) to ensure features are on a similar scale.


# Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
##Insights and Visualizations:

1. Churn Rate by Plan Type:
Visualization: Bar chart showing churn rate for different plan types.

Insight: Customers on the Basic Plan have the highest churn rate.

3. Churn by Tenure:
   
Visualization: Line plot of churn rate vs. tenure (in months).

Insight: Churn is highest within the first 3 months of service.

3. Support Tickets and Churn:

Visualization: Box plot of support tickets for churned and non-churned customers.

Insight: Customers who churn typically have more support tickets.

4. Correlation Heatmap:

Insight: Monthly Charges, Tenure, and Support Tickets show strong correlation with churn.


# Step 5: Model Building
1. Split the Data:
Train-Test Split: 80% for training, 20% for testing.
2. Choose the Model:
Logistic Regression (simple and interpretable).
Random Forest (handles non-linear relationships well).
XGBoost (highly efficient for large datasets).
3. Train the Model:
   
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

## Prepare features and target
X = df[['Monthly Charges', 'Tenure', 'Support Tickets']]
y = df['Churn'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Yes' else 0)

## Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Predict on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

4. Evaluate the Model:
python
Copy code

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Metrics:
Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 78%
Recall: 80%


# Step 6: Model Interpretation
Feature Importance:
Top 3 Features:
Tenure,
Monthly Charges,
Support Tickets,


# Step 7: Insights & Recommendations
## Insights:
1. New Customers Are More Likely to Churn: Customers with tenure < 3 months are at high risk.
2. Higher Support Tickets Correlate with Churn: Frequent customer support issues lead to dissatisfaction.
3. Plan Type Matters: Customers on the Basic Plan churn more frequently.
## Recommendations:
1. Onboarding Programs: Implement a better onboarding experience for new customers.
2. Customer Support Improvements: Reduce the number of support tickets by enhancing service quality.
3. Discounts for Basic Plan Users: Offer incentives or upgrades to higher-tier plans to retain Basic Plan customers.

# Step 8: Deployment & Monitoring
1. Deploy the Model: Use the model to predict churn risk in real-time for new customers.
2. Dashboard for Monitoring: Create a dashboard to visualize churn rates and model performance.
3. Regular Updates: Retrain the model quarterly with new data to maintain accuracy.


âœ… Conclusion:
This end-to-end data analytics case study illustrates how to identify and mitigate customer churn, improving retention for the telecom company.
